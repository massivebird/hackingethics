                <p class="indent">White hat hackers utilize their skills and knowledge in a safe environment. These are the
                    specialists who make a career out of their otherwise alarming skillsets. Companies and other entities
                    hire them (often through generous payment) to find holes in data bases and security systems, report the
                    issues, and eliminate the vulnerabilities. The <span class="bluetxt">mutual arrangement</span> between
                    the hacker and the client is what makes their work perfectly <span class="bluetxt">legal</span> and beneficial
                    to both parties.</p>
                <p class="indent">Large corportations and government bodies often run <span class="italic">"bug bounties"</span>
                    where both amateur and experienced hackers are invited to find holes and weaknesses within a designated site or domain. If
                    the rules are followed, then these people may be subsequently <span class="bluetxt">rewarded</span>
                    for their efforts. Their goal is to protect confidential and personal information from getting in the hands of rogue hackers.

                <p class="indent">Black hat hackers possess the same skills as white hats. However, their work is done not
                    to secure systems, but to take advantage of them. Often with the goals of financial gain, political attention,
                    or sabotage, black hats seek control over entire systems and databases, attempting to <span class="redtxt">illegally</span>
                    steal and sell personal information, forcefully promote their ideals, and damage the reputation of large entities.</p>
                <p class="indent">Similarly, <span class="italic redtxt">grey hat hackers</span> aim to surreptitiously identify
                    vulnerabilities within various websites and systems. However, instead of immediately stealing information,
                    they contact the server owner or entity, demanding money for the unspecified issue. Should the offer
                    be denied, the hackers may threaten to leak the vulnerability or deal damage to the system.</p>

                    <p class="indent">The internet is no longer a simple resource for information, but a tool, a utility,
                        and a keepsafe for our valuables. Anyone can choose to store nothing at all - or company records,
                        credit card numbers, and social security numbers. That being said, accessing foreign computer systems
                        without authorization is a <span class="redtxt">crime punishable by law</span>. The cyberspace holds
                        belongings just as important as those in the real world - and trespassers are promptly charged.</p>
                    <p class="indent">Computer crimes can range anywhere from identity theft, piracy, spreading malware or
                        viruses, and even espionage. In the State of Michigan, a large variety of actions are considered
                        cybercrimes. These can go on your legal record as either misdemeanors or felonies depending on how
                        much money is involved in the crime itself. Fines and jail time are also possible consequences and
                        can vary in severity.
